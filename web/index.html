<H2>Introduction</H2>

PostgreSQL is a database system derived from Postgres4.2. It conforms to 
(most of) ANSI SQL and offers many interesting capabilities (C dynamic linking
for functions or type definition, etc.). This package is copyright by the
Regents of the University of California, and is freely distributable.

<P>
Python is an interpreted programming language. It is object oriented, simple 
to use (light syntax, simple and straightforward statements), and has many 
extensions for building GUIs, interfacing with WWW, etc. An intelligent web
browser (HotJava like) is currently under development (November 1995), and
this should open programmers many doors. Python is copyrighted by Stichting S
Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is freely distributable.

<P>
PyGreSQL is a python module that interfaces to a PostgreSQL database. It
embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow easy use of the powerful
PostgreSQL features from a Python script.

<P>
PyGreSQL 2.0 was developed and tested on a NetBSD 1.3_BETA system.  It is 
based on the PyGres95 code written by Pascal Andre, andre@chimay.via.ecp.fr.
I changed the version to 2.0 and updated the code for Python 1.5 and
PostgreSQL 6.4.2.  While I was at it I upgraded the code to use full ANSI
style prototypes and changed the order of arguments to connect.  Version
2.1 is fixes and enhancements to that.  The current version works with
PostgreSQL 7.1.3.

<P>
This release fixes a few bugs, adds a few minor features and makes a
few speedups in the code.

<H2>Important changes for 3.2</H2>
<LI>Add WIN32 support (gerhard@bigfoot.de)

<LI>Treat timestamp like date for quoting purposes.

<H2>Mailing list</H2>

You can join
<A HREF="http://www.vex.net/mailman/listinfo/pygresql">the mailing list</A>
to discuss future development of the PyGreSQL interface.  This is usually
a low volume list except when there are new features being added.

<H2>Documentation</H2>

The documentation is contained in the <A HREF="README.txt">README</A> file
that comes with the package.

<H2>Examples</H2>

I am starting to collect examples of applications that use PyGreSQL.  So
far I only have a few but if you have an example for me, you can either
send me the files or the URL for me to point to.

<P>
Here is a <A HREF="http://www.druid.net/rides/">List of motorcycle rides
in Ontario</A> that uses a PostgreSQL database to store the rides.  There
is a link at the bottom of the page to view the source code.
