==========================
PyGreSQL future directions
==========================


To Do
-----

- The DB-API module needs docstrings and external documentation.
- Create separate unit tests for _pg, pg and pgdb.
- The large object and direct access functions need much more attention.
- An update query should return the number of rows affected.
- The C module needs to be cleaned up and redundant code merged.
- The fetch method should use real cursors.


Whish List
----------

- Users should be able to register their own types with _pg.
- I would like a new method that returns a dictionary
  of dictionaries from a SELECT.
- Add support for persistent and pooled connections
  that can be used in multi-threaded environments.
  (Maybe add modules from Christoph's Webware sandbox.)
- The API documentation could be created with Epydoc.
- Write a tutorial for beginners and advanced use.
- More and better documented examples.
- Provide more howtos for compiling and installing on
  various platforms.
- Provide binary packages, particularly a Win installer.
