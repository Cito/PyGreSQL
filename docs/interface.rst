Programming Interface
=====================

You may either choose to use the `"classic" PyGreSQL interface <classic>`_
provided by the `pg` module or else the
`DB-API 2.0 compliant interface <db_api>`_ provided by the `pgdb` module.

`DB-API 2.0 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_
(Python Database API Specification v2.0)
is a specification for connecting to databases (not only PostGreSQL)
from Python that has been developed by the Python DB-SIG in 1999.

The authoritative programming information for the DB-API is availabe at
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/

A tutorial-like introduction to the DB-API can be found at
